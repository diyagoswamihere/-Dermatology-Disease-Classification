# -Dermatology-Disease-Classification
This project performs machine learning-based classification of dermatological diseases using clinical features from a dermatology dataset. The goal is to preprocess data, evaluate multiple ML algorithms, and determine the best-performing model using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and cross-validation.
